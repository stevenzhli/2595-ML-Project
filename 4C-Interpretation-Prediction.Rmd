Tasks

- You must visualize the trends associated with the hardest to predict customer with respect to the most important sentiment derived feature.
  - Free to select whether you wish to visualize the regression model trends (transformed response) or the classification model trends (event probability).
  - Predictions should be made using the best performing model.
- You must visualize your predictive trends using the following style:
  - The primary input should be used as the x-aesthetic in a graphic.
  - The secondary input should be used as a facet variable â€“ it is recommended to use 4 to 6 unique values if your secondary input is a continuous variable.
  - You must decide what values to use for the remaining inputs.

- What conclusions can you draw from the predictive trends?

## Predict Unpredictable Customer

**Read in the respective best model for each task.**

```{r}
mod_rg_xgb <- readr::read_rds("./models/mod_2D_adv_best_wflow")
mod_cl_enet <- readr::read_rds("./models/mod_3D_enet_best_wflow")
```

----

## Regression

For my best regression model, the most important feature is the `xw_01`. 

```{r}

```

----

## Classification

For my best classification model, the top 2 most important features are `xn_01`, `xn_03`.
